# Marlin-backup

This is my personal back-up of my 2.0.5.2 Marlin adjusted for my printer.

Mods added to this printer are :

- Linear rails kit XZ (BLV ender 3 kit)
- Linear rails adapter Y (printermods)
- Ruthex glassfiber reinforced belts on XY
- Voron afterburner extruder (BMG internals + trianglelabs spider hotend)
- trianglelabs pancake stepper for my extruder
- 50W heater cartridge
- SKR1.4 Turbo with TMC2209's
- Dual Z independant driven
- Probably forgot to mention other things, but just to point out that it's not just copy / paste but check the settings for you're own and change them if needed.
